# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of our robotics education series. This module focuses on ROS 2 middleware for humanoid control, Python agents integration, and URDF modeling.

## About This Module

In this module, you will learn:
- The fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
- How to integrate Python agents with ROS 2
- How to model humanoid robots using URDF

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- AI/Robotics students
- Python users interested in robotics
- Developers working with humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Chapters

1. [ROS 2 Basics: Nodes, Topics, Services](./chapter-1-ros2-basics.md)
2. [Python & ROS 2: rclpy, publishers/subscribers](./chapter-2-python-ros2.md)
3. [URDF Modeling: Links, joints, sensors, simple humanoid](./chapter-3-urdf-modeling.md)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2
