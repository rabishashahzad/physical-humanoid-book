# Module 3: AI Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3 of the AI/Spec-Driven Robotics Book! This module focuses on creating an intelligent robot brain using NVIDIA Isaac, covering photorealistic simulation, visual SLAM, and advanced navigation for humanoid robots.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn how to:
- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation environments
- Implement Isaac ROS for Visual SLAM and navigation
- Develop NAV path planning specifically for humanoid robots

This module builds on your existing ROS 2 knowledge to introduce advanced GPU-accelerated robotics concepts using NVIDIA's Isaac platform.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- A solid understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Basic knowledge of computer vision and navigation
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for Isaac Sim
- Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS properly installed

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters that progressively build your understanding of the AI robot brain:

1. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim Photorealistic Simulation** - Learn to create realistic simulation environments
2. **Isaac ROS for VSLAM and Navigation** - Implement visual SLAM and perception pipelines
3. **NAV Path Planning for Humanoid Robots** - Advanced navigation techniques for humanoid robots

Let's begin exploring the powerful capabilities of NVIDIA Isaac for creating intelligent robotic systems!
