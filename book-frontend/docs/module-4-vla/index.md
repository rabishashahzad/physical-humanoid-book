# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the AI/Spec-Driven Robotics Book! This module focuses on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robots, integrating speech recognition, cognitive planning, and robotic action execution to create truly intelligent robots that can understand and respond to natural language commands.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn how to:
- Integrate OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition with ROS 2 systems
- Develop cognitive planning pipelines using LLMs for robotic task execution
- Create autonomous humanoid behaviors combining vision, language, and action
- Implement real-time voice-to-action systems with safety considerations

This module builds on your existing ROS 2 and AI knowledge to create sophisticated human-robot interaction systems that can understand natural language and execute complex tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Solid understanding of ROS 2 concepts and Python programming
- Basic knowledge of machine learning and neural networks
- OpenAI API access for LLM integration
- Whisper model installation for speech recognition
- Completed Modules 1-3 of this course

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters that progressively build your understanding of Vision-Language-Action systems:

1. **Voice-to-Action (Whisper Integration)** - Learn to integrate speech recognition with robotic systems
2. **Cognitive Planning (LLM → ROS 2)** - Develop intelligent planning systems using large language models
3. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid** - Combine all components into a complete autonomous system

Let's begin exploring the fascinating world of Vision-Language-Action systems that bridge human language and robotic action!
